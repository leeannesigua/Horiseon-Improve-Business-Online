# Horiseon-Improve-Business-Online

In this assignment, we were to modify the source code for the webpage to meet accessibility standards.
Criteria for accessibility standards was for the source code to have semantic HTML elements, HTML elements were to follow a logical structure, icon and image elements were to have alt attributes, the heading attributes had to be in sequential order, and the website had to have a descriptive title.

I changed the title of the website from “website” to “Horiseon: Improve Business Online.”

I spaced out the sections of code so it was easy to see where one section started and ended. There were div elements that had classes called header and footer, so I changed them into semantic elements, header and footer. I changed the div elements using the class=“content” and class=“benefits” into section elements to see where each section started and ended.

I added alt attributes to the img elements so that if the images don’t show in the browser the user will have a description of that image.

The website showed that if you clicked on one of the headers, it will take directly to the section of the name of that header. The first header was missing some code in order to do that function, so I added an id=“search-engine-optimization” to its div element to create that action.
